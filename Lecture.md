Probability model P(x) <br>
Assumptions: <br>
1.symmertic around the mean? <br>
2.Not synmmertic aorund the mean? <br>
3.How variable? concentrated around the mean or not <br>
Using possion model, only have one parameter (lambda) <br>

even if it is a good model, it will never be perfect. only one paratmenter controls mean and shape of distribution. <br>

> "All models are wrong but some models are useful." --- George Box <br>
It will depend on the assumptions of the model and the quality of input data. <br>
